StarsectorPrepatcher is a compatibility-first pre-load patching layer for Starsector. Its startup
javaagent runs before the game and mod classloaders begin normal loading, so guarded structural
patches can be applied at the point where the affected classes first enter the JVM.

The project has a broader direction than map optimization alone:

- maintain carefully verified performance and correctness patches for game internals;
- provide a stable, documented API for useful capabilities that Starsector's public API does not
  expose;
- keep version-specific bytecode knowledge inside the prepatcher instead of duplicating it across
  gameplay mods.

The public API is a roadmap item, not a published compatibility surface in `0.10.0`. Its intended
namespace is `com.starsector.prepatcher.api`; API types will only become supported once they are
documented and covered by compatibility tests.

## How it works

The distribution contains a sandbox-safe mod bootstrap and one startup agent:

```text
agent/StarsectorPrepatcherAgent.jar
```

The agent matches and verifies every patch independently, including hyperspace and fast-forward
presentation patches. Compatibility is decided from local method structure, data flow, control flow,
ownership markers, feature masks, and combined postconditions. Compatible localized or otherwise
repacked class files remain supported when the owned semantic surface is unchanged. Unknown,
ambiguous, partial, or foreign hook-shaped targets remain vanilla and the reason is written to the
diagnostic log.

The agent control code and the typed runtime are deliberately separated. At startup the agent reads
the `com.fs.starfarer.api.StarsectorPrepatcher*` runtime classfiles from its own JAR and defines them
in the classloader that owns Starsector's API. This keeps hook arguments loader-identical under both
the vanilla launcher and Faster Rendering's custom system classloader. The transformer is registered
only after that runtime is installed successfully, and it skips a target whose loader differs from
the runtime loader.

Fast-forward presentation coalescing is registered inside this same startup agent and its hooks are
part of the same game-loader runtime payload. It does not install or require a second javaagent; do
not install the original standalone FastForward Presentation Patch agent alongside Prepatcher.

The bootstrap plugin does not perform bytecode work. It exposes agent status through the normal game
log and warns when the mod is enabled without the startup agent.

## Installation

1. Fully close Starsector.
2. Extract the directory as `<Starsector>\mods\StarsectorPrepatcher`.
3. Install the agent for the launcher you use (commands below).
4. Enable **StarsectorPrepatcher** in the launcher and start the game.

For the vanilla launcher, run:

```bat
install-agent.bat
```

For Faster Rendering (`starsector-core\fr.bat`), run:

```bat
install-agent.bat -Target FasterRendering
```

To configure both launch paths, use `install-agent.bat -Target Both`. The installer understands
both vanilla's `vmparams` command line and Faster Rendering's `starsector-core\fr.vmparams` Java
argument file. For every changed file it creates a timestamped backup, replaces any existing entry
for this installation, and places Prepatcher after every other `-javaagent` option:

```text
-javaagent:../mods/StarsectorPrepatcher/agent/StarsectorPrepatcherAgent.jar
```

The folder name must not contain whitespace and should remain `StarsectorPrepatcher` after
installation. No additional `--add-exports` options are required; the agent exports the required JDK
ASM packages through `Instrumentation.redefineModule()`.

Install telemetry and other agents first, or rerun this installer afterward. Prepatcher must remain
the final `-javaagent` so its transformer sees the bytes returned by earlier agents.

The prepatcher does not modify save data, and its runtime caches are never serialized.

## Current patch areas

- sector, system, and Intel maps: reconciliation, spatial candidates, callbacks, hover checks,
  entity indexes, nebula metadata, scratch collections, and grid LOD;
- campaign and economy: lifecycle-bound caches, listener refresh, reusable snapshots, one unified
  scheduler for all transformed engine-owned market updates, corrected
  observation of direct mod `Market.advance()` calls, owner-local persistent copy-on-write
  market/condition/industry snapshots with structure epochs and bounded audits, an owner-local
  ReachEconomy fingerprint, an ordered inactive-commodity fast path combined with the direct
  expiry-aware `MutableStatWithTempMods` scheduler, a guarded dormant inherited-`BaseIndustry`
  fast path, repeated absent commodity event-mod removal suppression, empty-script/empty-memory
  fast paths, a structurally matched CoreScript core-worlds extent cache, and comm-relay candidates;
- routing: ordered jump-point and system indexes with vanilla selection and fallback semantics;
- combat and particles: internal scratch collections and stable deferred cleanup;
- fast-forward presentation: final-substep coalescing for guarded campaign visuals and continuous
  audio, with broader animation/fader/particle groups enabled by the default/aggressive profile;
- loading and save paths: literal parsing, progress redraw, and output-path fixes;
- hyperspace: terrain culling, layer selection, seeded random reuse, owner-local automaton buffers,
  and moving-starfield cleanup.

The complete switch and invariant reference is in [`docs/PATCHES.md`](docs/PATCHES.md).

## Configuration and rollback

All settings are in `prepatcher.properties`. Every user-facing patch group has a dedicated `patch.*`
switch and requires a full game restart. The following disables the entire prepatcher:

```properties
enabled=false
```

`patch.loadingTextReader` and `patch.startupLogAggregation` remain disabled in all supplied profiles
because they participated in confirmed mission-startup failures. They will not be re-enabled until
their fixes pass an isolated startup and mission suite.

The default, safe, and aggressive profiles keep expensive observers, CSV/stack sampling, verbose
transformation output, presentation metrics, and the periodic stats worker disabled. Copy
`profiles/debug.properties` over `prepatcher.properties` only for a bounded diagnostic session; it
inherits every aggressive-profile setting, enables all of those facilities, and writes additional
data below `logs/`. A repository consistency test enforces the aggressive-plus-diagnostics contract.

The safe profile enables the structurally matched fast-forward presentation master, frame marker,
and narrower visual/audio groups. The default profile exactly mirrors aggressive: global animations,
sensor faders, slipstream particles, and particle emitters are enabled despite their broader callback,
lifetime, RNG, and emission-cadence surface. `fastForward.visualTime=realtime` keeps presentation at one
ordinary update per outer frame, while `simulation` accumulates substep time and may produce visible
jumps. Simulation itself still runs on every substep.

`patch.marketScheduler` is enabled in the default/aggressive profile and routes every known core
`MarketAPI.advance(float)` call through one scheduler contract. The periodic Economy-loop and
planet-condition sources accumulate `amount` during each simulation tick, but cadence is evaluated
once per render batch. Starsector performs multiple `CampaignEngine.advance()` calls per rendered
frame when campaign speed is increased; the scheduler detects the final iteration through
`CampaignEngine.setFastForwardIteration(false)`, so ordinary and hot markets receive at most one
callback per render batch instead of scaling callback count with acceleration. Remote visible markets
use `market.scheduler.batches`; hidden remote markets use `market.scheduler.hiddenBatches`; current-
location, interaction, and player-owned markets use one callback per batch.

A market may explicitly opt out with the memory key
`$starsectorPrepatcher_perSimulationTickMarket=true`. Only these compatibility markets retain one
callback per simulation tick. Statistics report both the current number of opted-out markets and their
callback cost. Six rare vanilla create/remove call sites, direct mod calls, scheduler fail-open paths,
and pre-save flushes use a cheaper synchronous hook that consumes existing pending debt before the
original event callback. The scheduler activates only after its CampaignEngine lifecycle/batch,
validated `CampaignState` batch protocol, Economy source, entity source, and save-flush components
initialize; before that calls remain synchronous and accumulate no debt. The complete runtime
contract is documented in [docs/architecture/MARKET_SCHEDULER.md](docs/architecture/MARKET_SCHEDULER.md).

Runtime statistics use one `marketScheduler*` family. `marketSchedulerSimulationTicks` and
`marketSchedulerRenderBatches` expose the actual acceleration ratio; `marketSchedulerMaxTicksPerBatch`
shows the largest observed batch. Work counters distinguish accumulated input calls, delivered
callbacks, per-simulation-tick opt-outs, and synchronous debt consumption. Failure counters remain
split by concrete cause. A failed normal callback disables batching only for that market; a failed
pre-save callback discards the already-detached ambiguous debt, switches that market to immediate
execution, and aborts the save so a partially applied callback is never retried automatically.
Periodic counters use `sumThenReset()`.

`patch.directMarketObservation` is enabled only by the debug profile. It does
not throttle direct mod calls: each call remains synchronous and immediate. Known planet-condition
engine calls are reported separately from unknown entries, transformed call sites are written to the
manifest before first execution, and the unknown-stack budget renews every report interval. Per-run
CSV/stacks are written under `logs/direct-market-observe/session-*/`; validation-smoke directories are
visibly labelled and `session.json` records `sessionOrigin`. Disable observation after collecting data
to remove sampling overhead. `call-sites.csv` and `observations.csv` contain explicit `mod_id`,
`mod_name`, mod-directory, and JAR columns resolved from the owning mod's `mod_info.json`; `source`
remains available as the exact code-source path rather than being the only way to identify a mod.

Construction classification maintains aggregate reason/scan counters; the debug profile publishes
them in its periodic stats line. `Industry.isUpgrading()` is diagnostic-only. For `BaseIndustry` subclasses, full-rate policy uses
the authoritative raw `building` field rather than an overridden virtual `isBuilding()` result;
non-`BaseIndustry` implementations retain the interface-method fallback. Virtual-building reports with
raw `building=false` are counted and sampled separately but do not enable full-rate. Optional bounded
samples can be enabled with `observer.marketConstructionDiagnostics=true`; they are written under
`logs/market-construction-diagnostics/session-*/`, include effective/reported building state, separate
source industries, transition buckets, and scalar `BaseIndustry` state, retain no game objects, and do
not change scheduler behavior.

Run `uninstall-agent.bat` for vanilla, `uninstall-agent.bat -Target FasterRendering` for FR, or
`uninstall-agent.bat -Target Both` to remove both managed entries. Each changed file is backed up.

## Diagnostics and verification

Runtime logs:

```text
mods\StarsectorPrepatcher\logs\prepatcher.log
mods\StarsectorPrepatcher\logs\direct-market-observe\session-*\
mods\StarsectorPrepatcher\logs\market-construction-diagnostics\session-*\
```

The agent records `APPLIED`, `ALREADY_APPLIED`, `SKIPPED_STRUCTURAL`, `SKIPPED_COMPOSITION`,
`SKIPPED_LOADER`, `SKIPPED_ALREADY_LOADED`, or `SKIPPED_ERROR`. Presentation and hyperspace targets
use the same local structural status model as the other patches. Every skip is fail-open; `SKIPPED_LOADER`
must be investigated before calling that launch path compatible.

Run `verify-structural.bat` on Windows or `./verify-structural.sh` on Linux/macOS for the complete
documentation, structural, negative/idempotency, lifecycle/GC, runtime, hyperspace, and agent
startup suite. When `fr.jar` is present it also runs the real Faster Rendering classloader smoke.
